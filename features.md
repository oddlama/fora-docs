# Overview

## How is Fora different from existing tools?

First of all, you are probably here asking yourself why I wrote this. The answer is mainly
because I liked doing it. I always had my minor gripes with the existing well-known infra tools
that I wanted to address. Is Fora perfect? No. Certainly far from it.

I took a lot of inspiration from amazing existing tools like Ansible and pyinfra.
I urge you to check them out if you haven't already. If you require large-scale
deploys (>100 hosts), they are most likely a better choice and more mature tools.

I did especially focus on creating a tool thay I enjoy to use. This means I implemented concepts
that are important to me and tried to fix the things that bothered me previously.
In summary, I wanted a tool that

- is more developer friendly. I can already code python and I want access to the full capabilities of python at my fingertips when writing scripts or defining variables.
- minimizes hidden state and complexity. Often introduced by the tool itself (as what feels like weird magic). I especially want clean, easy and self-contained deploy scripts.
- is more like a dumb API. Except for initial setup like inventory loading, the tool should behave like a library without strange side-effects. Smart tools are always great, but sometimes dumb tools are better.
- focuses on being a tool for remote scripting and not a whole environment. Keeping the tool lightweight increases its maintainability and reduces the amount of
details one needs to learn about it. If you for example need to store a secret, you can already choose from a lot of good python libraries.
- properly deals with the dict merging vs. dict overwriting issue. Scripts should have the option to do both without.
- can detect variable definition conflicts. Imagine a host is in two group, which both define a variable `var`. Which definition is chosen? Instead, this should be an error.
- reduces boilerplate operation arguments. When configuring services you often need to create files for a specific user with certain permissions. Twenty times.
Therefore, I want to be able to temporarily change the defaults in a `with` block to reduce boilerplate and to keep my scripts readable.
- doesn't provide interpreted remote shell commands. I want the equivalent of a remote `subprocess.run`, so I don't have to worry about
escaping arguments but can spawn a shell when I need to.
- generally reduces friction where possible. When I just want to write a deploy for my dotfiles, a single (and short) `deploy.py` script should be all that is needed.
- provides useful output. It doesn't need to be super fancy. I just want to see the important information highlighted instead of a terminal-filling block of text
seemingly taken from `/dev/urandom` in a yellowish tint.

If you already know existing infrastructure tools and just want to see how Fora solves these problems,

## Features

🪶 **Lightweight.**
Fora is a framework for infrastrucutre automation. Not more, not less. It aims to
provide
It has no domain-specific-language and no complex logic.
If you need more, you can very easily extend it yourself or use one of the aforementioned tools.
With just `~2.6k` lines of code, Fora is really tiny.
As a reference: pyinfra is around `~11.1k`, and ansible beyond `>62.0k` (measured with [cloc](https://github.com/AlDanial/cloc)).

🌱 **Simple.** Writing deploys in Fora is designed to be simple.
Inventories, hosts, groups and scripts are just regular python scripts defining global variables.
This allows you to anything you like in these files without adding complexity to fora.

🎉⃠ **No surprises.** Fora focuses just on solving the core problem of infrastructure management,
and will not get in your way. Smart tools are great, but sometimes dumb tools are better.
Fora does exactly what you expect it to do and not more.

🐞 **Debuggable.** Fora shows state changes to remote hosts in a diff-like manner,
so you can easily spot what has changed. With `--diff` you can even get a diff of
files that were changed. Also in case an error occurs, stdout and stderr of the failed
remote command will be shown to ease debugging.

## Features

🕵️ agentless and fast for small inventories.
All commands are run through a single ssh session.
But, fora doesn't parallelize actions on multiple host. This means while
individual command chains are extremely fast, it can take a while to provision
more than a few hosts.

**Extendable.** Variables are inherited automatically. No setup necessary.

- cannot become root.
